summary: In the lecture, we will discuss the application of automated reasoning techniques in the verification of software and hardware components in electronic systems. This course will cover basic knowledge on logic, Satisfiability solvers, model checking and their applications. To cultivate interactive-learning, this course also includes seminars that promote discussions and serve as extensions to the lectures. Enrolled students are required to sign up for the presentations in the seminars.
