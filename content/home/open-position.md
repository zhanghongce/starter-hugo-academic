I'm looking for talented students (PhD/MPhil/RA) who are interested in exploring topics around hardware verification, firmware and systems-on-chip security.
 Some of the work in this area is closely related to the electronic design automation (EDA) industry and I expect such topics will recieve increasingly more focus and support in the near future. I also have an open-position for a post-doc. The salaries will be highly competitive.
