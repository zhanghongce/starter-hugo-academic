We present Pono, an open-source SMT-based model checker. Pono is designed to be both a research platform for developing and improving model checking algorithms, as well as a performance-competitive tool that can be used for academic and industry verification applications. In addition to performance, Pono prioritizes transparency (developed as an open-source project on GitHub), flexibility (Pono can be adapted to a variety of tasks by exploiting its general SMT-based interface), and extensibility (it is easy to add new algorithms and new back-end solvers).
